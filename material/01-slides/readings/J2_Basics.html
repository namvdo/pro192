<h1>Java Programming</h1>
<h2>Java Basics</h2>

<p>This chapter explains the basic syntaxes of the Java programming
language. I shall assume that you could write some simple programs
(otherwise, read "<a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J1a_Introduction.html">Introduction To Programming</a>").</p>

<h3>Revision</h3>

<p>Below is a simple Java program that demostrates the basic program constructs, such as <em>sequential flow</em>, <em>for-loop</em>, and <em>if-else</em>. Read "<a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J1a_Introduction.html">Introduction To Programming</a>" if you need help in understanding this program.</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Comments are used to document and explain your codes and logic.
Comments are not programming statements and are ignored by the
compiler, but they are crucial for others to read and understand your
program (and also to yourself three days later). You should use
comments <em>liberally</em> to explain important as well as salient
concepts. During program development, instead of deleting a chunk of
statements permanently, you could <em>comment-out</em> these statements so that you could get it back later, if needed.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of comments in Java:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Multi-line Comment</em>: begins with a "<code>/*</code>" and ends with a "<code>*/</code>" and can extend for more than one lines.</li>
<li><em>End-of-line Comment</em>: begins with "<code>//</code>" and lasts until the end of the current line.</li>
</ol>

<h3>White Spaces &amp; Programming Style</h3>
<p><em>Blank</em>, <em>tab</em> and <em>new-line</em> are collectively called <em>white spaces</em>. Java, like most of the computer languages, ignores <em>extra</em> white spaces.  That is, multiple contiguous white spaces are treated as one white space.</p>
<p> In Java, tab is denoted as <code>\t</code>, and newline is denoted as <code>\n</code>.</p>

<p>Proper indentation (with tab, blank and new-line) greatly improves
the readability of the program, which is extremely important for others
(and yourself) to read and understand your programs. But it has no
computational significance.</p>

<p><strong>Alignment of the beginning and ending braces</strong>: Place the beginning brace at the end of the line, and align the ending brace with the start of the statement.</p>

<p><strong>Identation</strong>: Ident the body by 3-4 spaces. I personally uses 3 spaces.</p>

<p>Refer to the above example for the proper programming style.</p>

<h3>Statements</h3>
<p>A programming <em>statement</em> performs a piece of action. A programming statement must be terminated by a semi-colon "<code>;</code>". For examples,</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-comment">// Each of the following lines is a programming statement, which ends with a semi-colon ';'.</span>
int number1 = 10;
int number2, number3=99;
int product;
product = number1 * number2 * number3;
System.out.println("Hello");
</pre>

<p>You could group several statements into a <em>block</em> surrounded by braces <code>{ }</code>. All the statements inside the block is treated as one unit. Blocks are used as the <em>body</em>
in constructs like class, method, if-else and for-loop. There is no
need to put a semi-colon after the closing brace to end a block. For
examples,</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-comment">// Each of the following lines is a complex statement comprising one or more blocks.
// No terminating semi-colon needed after the closing braces.
// Note that they are usually written over a few lines for readability.</span>
if (number &gt; 88) { System.out.println("Got it"); } else { System.out.println("Try Again"); }
for (int i = 1; i &lt; 100; i++) { System.out.println(i); }
while (i &lt; 8) { System.out.println(i); i++; }
public class Hello { <em>statements</em> }
public static void main(String[] args) { <em>statements</em> }
</pre>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>A <em>variable</em> is a <em>named</em> storage location that store a <em>value</em> of a particular <em>type</em>. It is called variable because you can change the value stored by assigning (and re-arranging) different value into it.</p>
<p> A variable is identified by its <em>name</em> (or <em>identifier</em>) and is associated with a <em>type</em> (such as <code>int</code> for integer, <code>double</code> for floating-point number, and <code>String</code> for texts). A variable must be declared with a <em>name</em> and a <em>type</em>, before it can be used in the program.  Once the <em>type</em>
of a variable is declared, it can only hold a value of that particular
type, and NOT value of the other types. For example, an <code>int</code>
(integer) variable can hold only an integer value, and NOT a
floating-point number or a text string. You can declare a variable (<em>name</em> and <em>type</em>) anywhere in your program, as long as it is declared before it is being used.  You can only declare the same variable once.</p>
<p>An <em>identifier</em> is needed to <em>name</em> a variable (or any other entities such as method, class or package). Java imposes the following <em>rules on identifiers</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An identifier is a sequence of characters, of any length, comprising letters <code>(a-z, A-Z)</code>, digits <code>(0-9)</code>, underscore '<code>_</code>', and dollar sign '<code>$</code>'.</li>
<li>White space (blank, tab, new-line) and other special characters (such as <code>'@'</code>, <code>'-'</code>, <code>'&amp;'</code>, etc.) are not allowed.</li>
<li>The letters are case-sensitive.</li>
<li>An identifier must begin with a letter or underscore. It cannot begin with a digit. Identifiers begin with "<code>$</code>" are reserved for system-generated entities.</li>
<li>An identifier cannot be a reserved word or literal (e.g., <code>class</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>then</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>).</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Variable Naming Convention:</strong> A variable name shall
be a noun, made up of one or several words.&nbsp;The first word is in
lowercase, while the remaining words are initial-capitalized (called <em>camel-case</em>). For example, <code>thefontSize</code>, <code>roomNumber</code>, <code>xMax</code>, <code>yMin</code>,  <code>xTopLeft</code> and <code>thisIsAVeryLongVariableName</code>. You should not use underscore (<code>'_'</code>) or dash (<code>'-'</code>)
to join the words. It is important to use a name that closely reflect
the meaning of the variable, instead of meaningless names like <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>i1</code>, <code>j99</code>.
You should use the singular and plural nouns prudently to differentiate
between singular and plural variables.&nbsp; For example, you may use
the variable <code>row</code> to refer to a single row and the variable <code>rows</code>  to refer to many rows.</p>

<p>For <em>constants</em>, the name shall make up of words in uppercase and joined with underscore. For example, <code>MAX_INTEGER</code>, <code>MIN_DOUBLE</code>.</p>

<p>The syntax for declaring variables is as follows:</p>

<table class="table-program">
<tbody><tr>
<th>SYNTAX</th>
<th>EXAMPLE</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="code-syntax"><span class="code-comment">// Declare one variable of the specified type</span>
<em>type identifier</em><strong>;</strong>

<em>type identifier-1</em><strong>,</strong> <em>identifier-2</em><strong>,</strong> ...<strong>,</strong> <em>identifier-n</em><strong>;</strong>
<span class="code-comment">// Declare one variable and assign an initial value</span>
<em>type identifier</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>value</em><strong>;</strong>
<span class="code-comment">// Declare more variables with initial values</span>
<em>type identifier-1</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>value-1</em><strong>,</strong> ...<strong>,</strong> <em>identifier-n</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>value-n</em><strong>;</strong>
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre class="code-explanation">&nbsp;
int option;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
int magicNumber = 88;
&nbsp;
String greetingMsg = "Hi!", quitMsg = "Bye!";
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Java is <em>case-sensitive</em>. A <code>rose</code> is NOT a <code>Rose</code>, and is NOT a <code>ROSE</code>.</p>

<h3>Literals</h3>
<p>A <em>literal</em> is a <em>fixed value</em>, e.g., 123, 3.1416, "Hello", that can be assigned to a variable.</p>

<h3>Expressions</h3>
<p>An <em>expression</em> is a combination of operators (e.g., <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>), operands (variables or literals), and sub-expressions, that can be <em>evaluated to yield a single value</em> of a certain type. For example,</p>
<pre class="code-example">1 + 2
sum + number
(number1 + 35.61) * number2 / number3
</pre>

<h3>Assignment</h3>
<p>An <em>assignment statement</em> assigns a literal value to a
variable; or evaluates an expression to obtain the resultant value and
assign the value to a variable. The syntax for assignment is:</p>

<table class="table-program">
<tbody><tr>
<th>SYNTAX</th>
<th>EXAMPLE</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="code-syntax"><span class="code-comment">// Assign the literal (RHS) to the variable (LHS)</span>
<em>variable</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>literal-value</em><strong>;</strong>
<span class="code-comment">// Evaluate the expression (RHS) and assign the result to the variable (LHS)</span>
<em>variable</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>expression</em><strong>;</strong>
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre class="code-explanation">&nbsp;
number = 88;
&nbsp;
sum = sum + number;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The symbol "<code>=</code>" is known as the <em>assignment operator</em>. The assignment statement should be interpreted this way: the <em>expression</em> at the right-hand-side (RHS) is evaluated first to produce a resultant value (called <em>rvalue</em> or right-value), and the <em>rvalue</em> is then assigned to the variable on the left-hand-side (LHS). Always evaluate the value of the RHS first. For examples,</p>
<pre class="code-example">number = 8;           <span class="code-comment">// Assign literal value of 8 to the variable number</span>
number = number + 1;  <span class="code-comment">// Evaluate the expression of number + 1,
                      //  and assign the resultant value back to the variable number</span></pre>

<p>The meaning of symbol "<code>=</code>" in programming is different from Mathematics. It denotes <em>assignment</em> instead of <em>equality</em>. The LHS must be a variable, while the RHS is a literal value; or an expression that evaluates to a value.  Note that <code>x = x + 1</code> is meaningful in programming (evaluate <code>x + 1</code> and assign the resultant value to the variable <code>x</code>) but illegal in Mathematics; while <code>x + y = 1</code>
is allowed in Mathematics but it cause a syntax error in programming
(because the LHS of an assignment statement must be a variable). Some
programming languages use "<code>:=</code>" or "←" as the assignment operator to avoid confusion with equality.</p>

<h3>Types</h3>
<p>In Java, a variable could belong to a <em>primitive</em> type (e.g., <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>) or an <em>object class</em>. We shall describe the primitive types here and object classes in the later chapters on Object-Oriented Programming.</p>

<img class="image-center" src="J2_Basics_files/Type-primitive.gif" alt="primitive types">

<p>Java has eight <em>primitive</em> types, as listed in the above table:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are four integer types: 8-bit <code>byte</code>, 16-bit <code>short</code>, 32-bit <code>int</code>  and 64-bit <code>long</code>. They are <em>signed</em> integers in 2's complement representation, and can hold an integer value of the various ranges as shown in the table.</li>
<li>There are two floating-point types: 32-bit single-precision <code>float</code> and 64-bit double-precision <code>double</code>, represented as specified by IEEE 754 standard. A  <code>float</code> can represent a number between <code>±1.40239846×10^-45</code> and <code>±3.40282347×10^38</code>, approximated. A <code>double</code> can represented a number between <code>±4.94065645841246544×10^-324</code> and <code>±1.79769313486231570×10^308</code>, approximated. Take note that not all real numbers can be represented by <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>, and many values are approprimated.</li>
<li>The type <code>char</code> represents a single character, such as <code>'0'</code>, <code>'A'</code>, <code>'a'</code>. In Java, char is represented using 16-bit Unicode (in UCS-2 format) to support internationalization (<em>i18n</em>). A <code>char</code> can be treated as a <em>16-bit unsigned integer</em>. For example, character <code>'0'</code> is 48 (decimal) or 30H (hexadecimal); character <code>'A'</code> is 65 (decimal) or 41H (hexadecimal); character <code>'a'</code> is 97 (decimal) or 61H (hexadecimal).</li>
<li>Java introduces a new <em>binary </em>type called "<code>boolean</code>", which takes a  value of either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another commonly-used type is <code>String</code>, which represents texts (or a sequence of characters) such as "Hello, world". <code>String</code> is not a primitive type, and will be further elaborated later. In Java, a char is enclosed by single quotes (e.g., <code>'A'</code>, <code>'0'</code>), while strings are enclosed by double quotes (e.g., <code>"Hello"</code>).</p>
<p>Read "<a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J9a_DataRepresentation.html">Data Representation</a>" if you wish to understand how the numbers and characters are represented inside the computer memory.</p>

<h3>Literals for Primitives &amp; String</h3>

<p>A <em>literal</em> is a  <em>fixed value</em>, such as <code>123</code>, <code>-456</code>, <code>3.14</code>, <code>'a'</code>, <code>"Hello"</code>,
that can be assigned directly to a variable; or used directly as part
of an expression. They are called literals because they literally and
explicitly identify themselves (in comparison with variable).</p>
<ul>
<li>An integer literal (i.e., a numeric literal without a decimal point), such as <code>123</code> and <code>-456</code>, is treated as an <code>int</code>. The range of 32-bit <code>int</code>  literals is <code>-2,147,483,628</code> (<code>-2^31</code>) to <code>2,147,483,627</code> (<code>2^31-1</code>). For example,</li>
<pre class="code-example">int number = -123;
int sum = 1234567890;         <span class="code-comment">// This value is within the range of int</span>
<span class="code-error">int bigSum = 11111111111111;</span>  <span class="code-comment">// ERROR: this value is outside the range of int</span>
</pre>
An <code>int</code> literal may precede with a plus (<code>+</code>) or minus (<code>-</code>) sign, followed by digits. No commas or special symbols (e.g., <code>$</code> or space) is allowed (e.g., <code>1,234</code> and <code>$123</code> are invalid). No preceding <code>0</code> is allowed too (e.g., <code>007</code> is invalid).

<li>A <code>long</code> literal above the <code>int</code> range requires a suffix <code>'L'</code> or <code>'l'</code> (avoid lowercase, which can be confused with the number one), e.g., <code>123456789012L</code>, <code>-9876543210l</code>. The range of 64-bit <code>long</code> literals is <code>-9,223,372,036,854,775,808L</code> (<code>-2^63</code>) to <code>9,223,372,036,854,775,807L</code> (<code>2^63-1</code>). For example,</li>
<pre class="code-example">long bigNumber = 1234567890123L;  <span class="code-comment">// Suffix 'L' needed</span>
long bigSum = 123;                <span class="code-comment">// int 123 auto-casts to long 123L</span>
</pre>

<li>No suffix is needed for <code>byte</code> and <code>short</code> literals. But you can only use integer values in the permitted range. For example,</li>

<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-error">byte smallNumber = 12345;</span> <span class="code-comment"> // ERROR: this value is outside the range of byte.</span>
byte smallNumber = 123;    <span class="code-comment">// This is within the range of byte</span>
short midSizeNumber = -12345;
</pre>

<li>A floating-point number (i.e., a numeric literal with a decimal point), such as <code>55.66</code> and <code>-33.44</code>, is treated as a <code>double</code>. You can also express them in scientific notation, e.g., <code>1.2e1.23</code>, <code>-5.5E-6.6</code>, where letter <code>e</code> or <code>E</code> denotes the exponent in power of 10. You could precede the fractional part or exponent with a plus (<code>+</code>) or minus (<code>-</code>) sign. There should be no space or other characters (e.g., space) in the number.</li>
<li>You MUST use a suffix of <code>'f'</code> or <code>'F'</code> for <code>float</code> literals, e.g., <code>-1.2345F</code>. For example,</li>

<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-error">float average = 55.66;</span>      <span class="code-comment">// Error, suffix 'f' needed</span>
float average = 55.66f;
</pre>

<li>A <code>char</code> literal is enclosed by <em>single quotes</em>, e.g., <code>'z'</code>, <code>'$'</code>, and <code>'9'</code>. As a <code>char</code> is treated as a 16-bit unsigned integer. In other words, you can assign an integer literal in the range of <code>[0, 65535]</code> to a <code>char</code> variable. For example,</li>
<pre class="code-example">char letter = 'a';                 <span class="code-comment">// Same as 97</span>
char anotherLetter = 98;           <span class="code-comment">// Same as the letter 'b'</span>
System.out.println(letter);        <span class="code-comment">// 'a' printed</span>
System.out.println(anotherLetter); <span class="code-comment">// 'b' printed instead of the number</span>
anotherLetter += 2;                <span class="code-comment">// 100 or 'd'</span>
System.out.println(anotherLetter); <span class="code-comment">// 'd' printed
</span></pre>

<li>A <code>String</code> literal is surrounded by <em>double quotes</em>, e.g., <code>"Hello, world!"</code>, <code>"The sum is "</code>. For example,</li>
<pre class="code-example">String directionMessage = "turn right";
String greetingMessage = "Hello";
</pre>

<li>There are only two <code>boolean</code> literals, i.e., <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. For example,</li>
<pre class="code-example">boolean done = true;
boolean gameOver = false;
</pre> 
</ul>

<h3>Special Characters</h3>
<p>You need to use a so-called <em>escape sequence</em>, which begins with a back-slash (<code>\</code>), to represent  special characters. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>new-line (<code>\n</code>) and tab (<code>\t</code>), which are non-printable.</li>
<li>double-quote (<code>\"</code>) and back-slash (<code>\\</code>), to resolve ambiguity inside a double-quoted string.</li>
</ul>

<table class="table-data">
<tbody><tr>
<th>ESCAPE SEQUENCE</th>
<th>DESCRIPTION</th>
<th>UNICODE (DECIMAL)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="td-center"><code>\n</code></td>

<td class="td-center"><code><em>hhhh</em>H</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>To place a double-quote inside a string (which is surrounded by a pair of double-quotes), you need to use escape sequence <code>\"</code>, so that it can be distinguished from the ending double-quote.</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>
<pre class="code-output">System.out.println("Use \\\" to place\n a \" within\ta\tstring");
</pre>

<p><strong>TRY:</strong></p>
<p>Write a program to print the following picture. Take note that you need to use escape sequences to print special characters.</p>

<p>Java supports the following arithmetic operators for numbers (<code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>char</code> (treated as 16-bit unsigned integer)):</p>

<table class="table-data">
<tbody><tr>
  <th>OPERATOR</th>
  <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
  <th>EXAMPLES</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>+</strong></code></td>
  <td>Addition</td>
  <td><code>1 + 2 → 3;  1.1 + 2.2 → 3.3</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>-</strong></code></td>
  <td>Subtraction</td>
  <td><code>2 + 1 → 1;  3.3 + 2.2 → 1.1</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>*</strong></code></td>
  <td>Multiplication</td>
  <td><code>2 * 3 → 6;  3.3 * 1.0 → 3.3</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>/</strong></code></td>
  <td>Division</td>
  <td><code>1 / 2 → 0;  1.0 / 2.0 → 0.5</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>%</strong></code></td>
  <td>Modulus (Divison Remainder)</td>
  <td><code>5 % 2 → 1;  6 % 2 → 0</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>All the above are <em>binary</em> operators, i.e., they take two operands.</p>

<p>It is important to take note that <code>int / int</code> produces an <code>int</code>, with the result <em>truncated</em>, e.g.,<code> 1/2 → 0 </code>(instead of 0.5).</p>

<p>If both the operands of an arithmetic operation belong to the <em>same type</em>, the operation is carried out in that type, and the result belongs to that type. For example, <code>int / int → int; double / double → double</code>.</p>
<p>However, if the two operands belong to <em>different types</em>, the value of the <em>smaller</em> type is promoted automatically to the <em>larger</em> type. The operation is then carried out in the <em>larger</em> type. For example, <code>int / double → double / double → double</code>. Hence, <code>1/2 → 0, 1.0/2.0 → 0.5, 1.0/2 → 0.5, 1/2.0 → 0.5</code>.</p>

<p>Take note that Java does not have an exponent operator (<code>'^'</code> is used for exclusive-or, not exponent).</p>

<h3>Type Casting</h3>
<p>In Java, you will get a <em>syntax error</em> if you try to assign a <code>double</code> value of to an <code>int</code> variable. This is because the <em>fractional</em> part could be lost, and the compiler signals an error in case that you were not aware. For example,</p>
<pre class="code-example">double f = 3.5;
int i;
<span class="code-error">i = f;</span>               <span class="code-comment">// Error (due to possible loss of precision)</span>
<span class="code-error">int number = 55.66;</span>  <span class="code-comment">// Error</span>
</pre>

<p>To assign the a <code>double</code> value to an <code>int</code> variable, you need to<em> </em>invoke the so-called <em>type-casting operator</em> - in the form of <code>(int)</code> - to operate on the <code>double</code> value and return an <code>int</code>. You can then assign the resultant <code>int</code> value to the <code>int</code> variable. For example,</p>
<pre class="code-example">double f = 3.5;
int i;
i = (int) f;    <span class="code-comment">// Cast double value of 3.5 to int. Assign the resultant value 3 to i</span>
                <span class="code-comment">// Casting from double to int <em>truncates</em>.</span>
</pre>

<p>In other words, type casting is an operation which takes one
operand. It operates on its operand, and returns the resultant value.
This is just like an addition operation although that involves two
operands.</p>

<p>Explicit type-casting is not required if you assign an <code>int</code> value to a <code>double</code>
variable, because there is no possible loss of precision. The compiler
will perform the type-casting automatically. For example,,</p>
<pre class="code-example">int i = 3;
double f;
f = i;           <span class="code-comment">// OK, no explicit type casting required</span>
                 <span class="code-comment">// f = 3.0</span>
f = (double) i;  <span class="code-comment">// Explicit type casting operator used here</span>
double aDouble = 55;   <span class="code-comment">// Compiler auto-casts to 55.0</span>
double nought = 0;     <span class="code-comment">// Compiler auto-casts to 0.0, int 0 and double 0.0 is different.</span>
double average = (double)sum / count;  <span class="code-comment">// Assume sum and count are int</span>
</pre>

<p>EXAMPLE 1: Suppose that you want to find the average (in <code>double</code>) of the integers between <code>1</code> and <code>100</code>. Study the following codes:</p>
<pre class="code-listing">int sum;
double average;
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
   sum = sum + i;      <span class="code-comment">// Final sum is int 5050</span>
}
average = sum / 100;   <span class="code-comment">// Won't work (average = 50.0 instead of 50.5)</span>
</pre>

<p>This is because both the <code>sum</code> and <code>100</code> are <code>int</code>. The result of division is an <code>int</code>, which is then implicitly casted to <code>double</code> and assign to the <code>double</code> variable.  To get the correct answer, you can do either:</p>
<pre class="code-example">average = (double)sum / 100;     <span class="code-comment">// Cast sum from int to double before division</span>
average = sum / (double)100;     <span class="code-comment">// Cast 100 from int to double before division</span>
average = sum / 100.0;
average = (double)(sum / 100);   <span class="code-comment">// Won't work. why?</span>
</pre>

<p>EXAMPLE 2: Suppose that you want to generate a random <code>int</code> between <code>0</code> and <code>99</code> (inclusive).  Java provides a method called <code>Math.random()</code>, which returns a <code>double</code> between <code>0.0</code> (inclusive) and <code>1.0</code> (exclusive).</p>
<pre class="code-example">int secretNumber;
secretNumber = (int) (Math.random() * 100);
</pre> 

<h3>More Assignment Operators</h3>
<p>Besides the usual simple assignment operator <code>'='</code> described earlier, Java also provides the so-called <em>compound assignment operator</em>s listed as follows:</p>

<table class="table-data">
<tbody><tr>
  <th>OPERATOR</th>
  <th>EXAMPLE</th>
  <th>RESULT</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>=</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>x = 5</code></td>
  <td>Assign the value of the LHS to the variable at the RHS</td>  
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>+=</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>x += 5</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> x = x + 5</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>-=</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>x -= 5</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> x = x - 5</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>*=</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>x *= 5</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> x = x * 5</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>/=</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>x /= 5</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> x = x / 5</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>%=</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>x %= 5</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> x = x % 5</code></td>  
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Pre- and Post- Increment/Decrement</h3>
<p>Like C++, Java supports the unary arithmetic operators: increment <code>'++'</code> and decrement <code>'--'</code> (by one).</p>
<table class="table-data">
<tbody><tr>
  <th>OPERATOR</th>
  <th>EXAMPLE</th>
  <th>RESULT</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>++</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>x++; ++x</code></td>
  <td>Increment by 1, same as<code> x += 1</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>--</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>x--; --x</code></td>
  <td>Decrement by 1, same as<code> x -= 1</code></td>  
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The increment/decrement unary operator can be placed before the
operand (pre), or after the operands (post), which takes on different
meaning.</p>

<table class="table-data">
<tbody><tr>
  <th>OPERATOR</th>
  <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
  <th>EXAMPLE</th>
  <th>RESULT</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>var++</strong></code></td>
  <td>Post-Increment (do increment last)</td>
  <td><code>y = x++;</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> y = x; x +=  1;</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>++var</strong></code></td>
  <td>Pre-Increment (do increment first)</td>
  <td><code>y = ++x;</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> x += 1; y = x;</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>var--</strong></code></td>
  <td>Post-Decrement</td>
  <td><code>y = x--;</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> y = x; x -= 1;</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>--var</strong></code></td>
  <td>Pre-Decrement</td>
  <td><code>y = --x;</code></td>
  <td>same as<code> x -= 1; y = x;</code></td>  
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If '++' or '--' involves another operation, then pre- or post- is
important to specify the order of the two operations. For examples,</p>
<pre class="code-example">x = 5;
System.out.println(x++);  <span class="code-comment">// Print x (5), then increment x (=6). Output is 5.</span>
x = 5;
System.out.println(++x);  <span class="code-comment">// Increment x (=6), then print x (6). Output is 6.</span>
</pre>

<h3>Comparison &amp; "boolean" type</h3>
<p>Very often, you need to compare two values before deciding on the
action to be taken, e.g. if mark is less than 50, print "FAIL!".</p>
<p>Java provides six <em>comparison operators</em> (or <em>relational operators</em>):</p>

<table class="table-data">
<tbody><tr>
  <th>OPERATOR</th>
  <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
  <th>EXAMPLE (x=5, y=8)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>==</strong></code></td>
  <td>Equal to</td>
  <td><code>(x == y) → false</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>!=</strong></code></td>
  <td>Not Equal to</td>
  <td><code>(x != y) → true</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>&gt;</strong></code></td>
  <td>Greater than</td>
  <td><code>(x &gt; y) → false</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>&gt;=</strong></code></td>
  <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
  <td><code>(x &gt;= 5) → true</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>&lt;</strong></code></td>
  <td>Less than</td>
  <td><code>(y &lt; 8) → false</code></td>  
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>&lt;=</strong></code></td>
  <td>Less than or equal to</td>
  <td><code>(y &lt;= 8) → true</code></td>  
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In Java, these comparison operations returns a <code>boolean</code>  value of either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Each comparison operation involves two operands, e.g., <code>x &lt;= 100</code>. It is invalid to write <code>1 &lt; x &lt; 100</code> in programming. Instead, you need to break out the two comparison operations <code>x &gt; 1</code>, <code>x &lt; 100</code>, and join with with a logical AND operator, i.e., <code>(x &gt; 1) &amp;&amp; (x &lt; 100)</code>, where <code>&amp;&amp;</code> denotes AND operator.</p>
<p>Java provides four logical operators (which operate on <code>boolean</code> operands only):</p>

<h3>Flow Control</h3>
<p>There are three basic flow control constructs - <em>sequential</em>, <em>conditional</em>, and <em>loop</em>, as illustrated below.</p>

<img class="image-center" src="J2_Basics_files/construct-structure.gif" alt="structure constructs">

<h4>Sequential Flow Control</h4>

<p>A program is a sequence of instructions. <em>Sequential</em> is the
most common and straight-forward flow, where programming statements are
executed in the order that they are written - from top to bottom in a
sequential manner, as illustrated bellow.</p>

<img class="image-center" src="J2_Basics_files/construct-sequential.png" alt="sequential construct">

<h4>Conditional Flow Control</h4>
<p>There are a few types of conditionals, <em>if-then</em>, <em>if-then-else</em>, <em>nested-if</em> (<em>if-elseif-elseif-...-else</em>), <em>switch-case</em>, and <em>shorthand-if-else</em>.</p>

<p>In a <em>switch-case</em> statement, a <code>break</code> statement is needed for each of the cases. If <code>break</code> is missing, execution will flow through the following case.  You can use either an <code>int</code> or <code>char</code> variable as the case-<em>selector</em>.</p> 

<div align="center">

<img class="image-center" src="J2_Basics_files/construct-switch-case.gif" alt="switch-case">

<p>You could omit the braces <code>{ }</code>, if there is only one
statement inside the block. However, I recommend that you keep the
braces to improve the readability of your program. For example,</p>
<pre class="code-example">if (mark &gt;= 50) 
   System.out.println("PASS");   <span class="code-comment">// only one statement, can omit { }</span>
else {                           <span class="code-comment">// more than one statements, need { }</span>
   System.out.println("FAIL");
   System.out.println("Try Harder!");
}
</pre>

<h4>Loop Flow Control</h4>
<p>Again, there are a few types of loops: <em>for-loop</em>, <em>while-do</em>, and <em>do-while</em>.</p>

<table class="table-program">

<tbody><tr>

do {
   sum += number;
   number++;
} while (number &lt;= 1000) ;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The difference between <em>while-do</em> and <em>do-while</em> lies in the order of the <em>body</em> and <em>condition</em>. In <em>while-do</em>, the <em>condition</em> is tested first. The body will be executed if the <em>condition</em> is true and the process repeats.  In <em>do-while</em>, the <em>body</em> is executed and then the <em>condition</em> is tested. Take note that the <em>body</em> of <em>do-while</em> will be executed at least once (vs. possibly zero for <em>while-do</em>).</p>

<p>Suppose that your program prompts user for a number between <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>, and checks for valid input, do-while with a boolean flag could be more appropriate.</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-comment">// Input with validity check</span>
boolean valid = false;
int number;
do {
  <span class="code-comment">// prompt user to enter an int between 1 and 10</span>
  ......
  <span class="code-comment">// if the number entered is valid, set done to exit the loop</span>
  if (number &gt;=1 &amp;&amp; number &lt;= 10) {
     valid = true;
  }
} while (!valid);   <span class="code-comment">// Need a semi-colon to terminate do-while</span>
</pre> 

<p>Below is an example of using while-do:</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-comment">// Game loop</span>
boolean gameOver = false;
while (!gameOver) {
   <span class="code-comment">// play the game</span>
   ......
   <span class="code-comment">// Update the game state 
   // Set gameOver to true if appropriate to exit the game loop</span>

<h4>"break" and "continue" Statements</h4>
<p>The <code>break</code> statement breaks out and exits the current (innermost) loop.</p>
<p>The <code>continue</code> statement aborts the current iteration and continue to the next iteration of the current (innermost) loop.</p>
<p><code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> are poor structures as
they are hard to read and hard to follow. Use them only if absolutely
necessary. You can always write the same program without using <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <code>break</code></p>
<pre class="code-listing"><span class="code-comment">// Find all prime numbers x between 1 and xMax</span>
for (int x = 1; x &lt;= xMax; x++) {
   <span class="code-comment">// Look for factor between 2 and sqrt of x</span>
   int maxFactor = (int)Math.sqrt(x);
   for (int factor = 2; factor &lt; maxFactor; factor++) {
      if (x % factor == 0) {   <span class="code-comment">// Factor of x?</span>
         System.out.println(x + " is not a prime");
         break;   <span class="code-comment">// A factor found, no need to search for more factor for this x</span> 
      }
   }
}
</pre>
<p>Try rewriting this program using without using <code>break</code> statement.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <code>continue</code></p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-comment">// Sum 1 to n, exclude 11, 22, 33,...</span>
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
   if (i % 11 == 0) continue;  <span class="code-comment">// Skip the rest of statements, continue to the next iteration
</span>   sum += i;
}
<span class="code-comment">// It is better to re-write the loop as:</span>
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
   if (i % 11 != 0) sum += i;
}
</pre>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code></p>
<pre class="code-listing">public class EgBreakContinue {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int number = 1;
      while(true) {
         number++;
         if ((number % 3) == 0) continue;
         if (number == 133) break;
         if ((number % 2) == 0) {
            number += 3;
         } else {
            number -= 3;
         }
         System.out.print(number + " ");
      }
   }
}
</pre>

<h4>Pre-mature Termination</h4>
<p>You could invoke the method <code>System.exit(int exitCode)</code> to terminate the program and return the control to the runtime.  By convention, a non-zero <code>exitCode</code> indicates <em>abnormal termination</em>. For example,</p>
<pre class="code-example">if (errorCount &gt; 10) {
   System.out.println("too many errors");
   System.exit(1);  <span class="code-comment">// Terminate the program</span>
}
</pre>

<p>You could also use a <code>return</code> statement in the <code>main()</code> method to terminate the program and return control back to the Java Runtime.
 For example,</p>
 <pre class="code-example">public static void main(String[] args) {
   ...
   if (errorCount &gt; 10) {
      System.out.println("too many errors");
      return;  <span class="code-comment">// Terminate and return control to Java Runtime from main()</span>
   }
   ...
}
</pre>

<h4>Nested Loops</h4>

<p>Try out the following program, which prints a 8-by-8 checker box pattern using <em>nested loops</em>, as follows:</p>

<pre class="code-output"># # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #

public class PrintPattern {  <span class="code-comment">  // to save as "PrintPattern.java"</span>
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int size = 8;
      for (int row = 1; row &lt;= size; row++) {   <span class="code-comment">  // outer loop to print all the rows</span>
         for (int col = 1; col &lt;= size; col++) {  <span class="code-comment">// inner loop to print one row</span>
            System.out.print("# ");
         }
         System.out.println();   <span class="code-comment">// row ended, bring the cursor to next line</span>
      }
   }
}
</pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>This program contains two <em>nested</em> for-loops. The inner loop is used to print a row of eight "<code># </code>", which is followed by printing a newline. The outer loop repeats the inner loop to print all the rows.</p>

<p>Suppose that you want to print this pattern instead:</p>
<pre class="code-output"># # # # # # # #
 # # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
 # # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
 # # # # # # # #
# # # # # # # #
 # # # # # # # #
</pre>

<p>You need to print an additional space for even-number rows.  You could do so by adding the following statement before Line 8.</p>
<pre class="code-example">if ((number % 2) == 0) {   <span class="code-comment">// print a leading space for even-numbered rows</span>
   System.out.print(" ");
}
</pre>


<h4>Some Issues in Flow Control</h4>

<p><strong>Dangling Else</strong></p>
<p>The "dangling else" problem can be illustrated as follows:</p>
<pre class="code-example">if (i == 0)
   if (j == 0)
      System.out.println("i and j are zero");
else System.out.println("i is not zero");   <span class="code-comment">// intend for the outer-if</span>
</pre>

<p>The <code>else</code> clause in the above codes is syntactically
applicable to both the outer-if and the inner-if. Java compiler always
associate the <code>else</code> clause with the innermost if (i.e.,
the nearest if). Dangling else can be resolved by applying explicit
parentheses. The above codes are logically incorrect and require
explicit parentheses as shown below.</p>
<pre class="code-example">if ( i == 0) {
   if (j == 0) System.out.println("i and j are zero");
} else {
   System.out.println("i is not zero");   <span class="code-comment">// non-ambiguous for outer-if</span>
}
</pre>

<p><strong>Endless loop</strong></p>
<p>The following constructs:</p>
<pre class="code-example">while (true) { ... }
</pre>
<p>is commonly used.  It seems to be an endless loop (or infinite loop), but it is usually terminated via a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> statement inside the loop body. This kind of code is hard to read - avoid if possible by re-writing the condition.</p>

<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>A <code>String</code> is a sequence of 16-bit Unicode characters. A string literal is surrounded by a pair of double quotes, e.g.,</p>

<pre class="code-example">String s1 = "Hi, This is a string!"  <span class="code-comment">// String literals are enclosed in double quotes</span>
String s2 = ""                       <span class="code-comment">// An empty string</span>
</pre>

<p>You need to use an escape sequence for special control characters (such as new-line <code>\n</code> and tab <code>\t</code>), double-quote <code>\"</code> and backslash <code>\\</code> (due to conflict) and Unicode character <code>\u<em>hhhh</em></code> (if your editor does not support Unicode input), e.g.,</p>

<pre class="code-example">String s3 = "A \"string" nested \\inside\\ a string"
String s4 = "Hello, \u60a8\u597d!"   <span class="code-comment">// "Hello, 您好!"</span>
</pre>

<p>Single-quote (<code>'</code>) does not require an escape sign.</p>
<pre class="code-example">String s5 = "Hi, I'm a string!"      <span class="code-comment">// Single quote OK</span>
</pre>

<h4>String and '+' Operator</h4>
<p>In Java, <code>'+'</code> is a special operator. It is <em>overloaded</em>. <em>Overloading</em> means that it carries out different operations depending on the types of its two operands.</p>
<ul>
<li>If both operands are numbers (<code>byte</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>char</code>), <code>'+'</code> performs the usual <em>addition</em>, e.g.,</li>
<pre class="code-example">1 + 2 → 3
1.2 + 2.2 → 3.4
</pre>

<li>If both operands are <code>String</code>s, <code>'+'</code> <em>concatenates</em> the two Strings and returns the concatenated <code>String</code>. E.g.,</li>
<pre class="code-example">"Hello" + "world" → "Helloworld"
"Hi" + ", " + "world" + "!" → "Hi, world!"</pre>

<li>If one of the operand is a <code>String</code> and the other is numeric, the numeric operand will be converted to <code>String</code> and the two <code>String</code>s concatenated, e.g.,</li>
<pre class="code-example">"The number is " + 5 → "The number is " + "5" → "The number is 5"
"The average is " + average + "!" (suppose average=5.5) → "The average is " + "5.5" + "!" → "The average is 5.5!"
"How about " + a + b (suppose a=1, b=1) → "How about 11"
</pre>
</ul>

<h4>String Operations</h4>
<p>Many methods are available for <code>String</code> operations, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="code-example">String str = "Java is cool!";
System.out.println(str.length());            <span class="code-comment">// return int 13</span>
System.out.println(str.charAt(2)0;           <span class="code-comment">// return char 'v'</span>
System.out.println(str.substring(0, 3));     <span class="code-comment">// return String "Jav"</span>
System.out.println(str.indexOf('a'));        <span class="code-comment">// return int 1</span>
System.out.println(str.lastIndexOf('a'));    <span class="code-comment">// return int 3</span>
System.out.println(str.endsWith("cool!"));   <span class="code-comment">// return boolean true</span>
System.out.println(str.toUpperCase());       <span class="code-comment">// return a new String "JAVA IS COOL!"</span>
&nbsp;
String str2 = "Java is COOL!";
<span class="code-comment">// compare two Strings</span>
System.out.println(str.equals(str2));           <span class="code-comment">// return boolean false</span>
System.out.println(str.equalsIgnoreCase(str2)); <span class="code-comment">// return boolean true</span>
<span class="code-comment">// (str == str1) to compare String is WRONG!!!</span>
</pre>

<p>To check all the available methods for <code>String</code>, open JDK API documentation ⇒ select <em>package</em> "<code>java.lang</code>" ⇒ select <em>class</em> "<code>String</code>" ⇒ choose <em>method</em>.</p>


<h4>String &amp; Primitive Conversion</h4>
<p>You could use the JDK built-in methods <code>Integer.parseInt()</code> to convert a <code>String</code> (representing an integer) into an <code>int</code>, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="code-example">String inStr = "5566";
int number = Integer.parseInt(inStr);
</pre>
<p>Similarly, you could use <code>Double.parseDouble()</code> or <code>Float.parseFloat()</code> to convert a String (of floating-point number) into a <code>double</code> or <code>float</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre class="code-example">String inStr = "55.66";
float aFloat = Float.parseFloat(inStr);
double aDouble = Double.parseDouble("1.2345");
</pre>

<p>You can use <code>charAt()</code> to extract individual character from a String, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-comment">// Converting from binary to decimal</span>
String msg = "101100111001!";
for (int pos = 0; pos &lt; msg.length(); pos++) {
   char binChar = msg.charAt(pos);   <span class="code-comment">// Extract character at pos</span>
   <span class="code-comment">// Do something about the character</span>
   .......
}
</pre>

<p>To convert a primitive to a <code>String</code>, you can use the '+' operator to simply concatenate the primitive with an <em>empty</em> <code>String</code>, or use the JDK method <code>String.valueOf()</code>, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="code-example">"" + 123 → "123"
12.34 + "" → "12.34"
String s1 = String.valueOf(12345);   <span class="code-comment">// "12345"</span>
double d = 55.66;
String s2 = String.valueOf(d);       <span class="code-comment">// "55.66"</span>
</pre>

<h3>Writing Correct &amp; Good Programs</h3>
<p>It is important to write programs that produce the correct results.
It is also important to write programs that others (and you yourself
three days later) can understand, so that the programs can be
maintained - I call these programs good programs.</p>

<p>Here are the suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow established convention so that everyone has the same basis
of understanding. To program in Java, you MUTST read the "Code
Convention for the Java Programming Language" (hyperlink at the JDK
documentation).</li>
<li>Format and layout of the source code with appropriate indents,
white spaces and white lines. Use 3 or 4 spaces for indent, and blank
line to separate sections of codes. Use "mono-space" fonts for writing
your program.</li>
<li>Choose good names that are descriptive and meaningful, e.g., <code>row</code>, <code>col</code>, <code>size</code>, <code>xMax</code>, <code>numStudents</code>. Do not use <code>i1</code>, <code>i2</code>, <code>i3</code> and <code>i99</code>. Use <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> only for temporary variables with short scope.</li>
<li>Provide sufficient comments to explain the important as well as salient concepts.</li>
<li>Write your program documentation while writing your programs.</li>
<li>Avoid <em>un-structured</em> constructs, such as <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>, which are hard to follow.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Programming Errors</h4>
<p>There are generally three classes of programming errors:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Compilation Error</em> (or <em>Syntax Error</em>): can be fixed easily.</li>
<li><em>Runtime Error</em>: program halts pre-maturely without producing the results - can also be fixed easily.</li>
<li><em>Logical Error</em>: program completes but produces incorrect
results. It is easy to detect if the program always produces wrong
result. It is extremely hard to fix if the program produces the correct
result most of the times, but incorrect result sometimes. For example,
<pre class="code-example"><span class="code-comment">// Can compile and execute, but give wrong result – sometimes!</span>
if (mark &gt; 50) {
   System.out.println("PASS");
} else {
   System.out.println("FAIL");
}
</pre>This kind of errors is very serious if it is not caught before
production. Writing good programs helps in minimizing and detecting
these errors. A good <em>testing strategy</em> is needed to ascertain the correctness of the program. <em>Software testing</em> is an advanced topics which is beyond our current scope.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Debugging Programs</h4>
<p>Here are the common debugging techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stare at the screen! Unfortunately, errors usually won't pop-up even if you stare at it extremely hard.</li>
<li>Study the error messages! Do not close the console when error
occurs and pretending that everything is fine. This helps most of the
times.</li>
<li>Insert print statements at appropriate locations to display the
intermediate results. It works for simple toy program, but it is
neither effective nor efficient for complex program.</li>
<li>Use a graphic debugger. This is the most effective means. Trace
program execution step-by-step and watch the value of variables and
outputs.</li>
<li>Advanced tools such as profiler (needed for checking memory leak and method usage).</li>
<li>Proper program testing to wipe out the logical errors.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Input &amp; Output</h3>

<h4>Formatted Output via "printf()" (Java SE 5)</h4>

<p><code>System.out.print()</code> and <code>println()</code> do not provide output formatting, such as controlling the number of spaces to print an <code>int</code> and the number of decimal places for a <code>double</code>.</p>
<p>Java SE 5 introduced a new method called <code>printf()</code> for formatted output (which is modeled after C Language's <code>printf()</code>). <code>printf()</code> takes the following form:</p>

<pre class="code-syntax">printf(<em>formatting-string</em>, <em>arg1</em>, <em>arg2</em>, <em>arg3</em>, ... );
</pre>

<p><em>Formatting-string</em> contains both <em>normal texts</em> and the so-called <em>Format Specifier</em>s.
Normal texts (including white spaces) will be printed as they are.
Format specifiers, however, will be substituted by the arguments
following the formatting-string, usually in a one-to-one and sequential
manner. A format specifier begins with a <code>'%'</code> and followed by the formatting code, e.g., <code>%d</code> for integer, <code>%f</code> for floating-point number, <code>%c</code> for character and <code>%s</code>
for string. Optional codes can be inserted in between to specify format
such as width, precision for floating point number, alignment and
padding. For examples,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>%nd</code>: integer printed in <code>n</code> spaces (<code>n</code> is optional).</li>
<li><code>%ns</code>: String printed in <code>n</code> spaces (<code>n</code> is optional). If <code>n</code> is omitted, the number of spaces is the length of the string.</li>
<li><code>%n.mf</code>: Floating point number (<code>float</code> and <code>double</code>) printed in <code>n</code> spaces with <code>m</code> decimal digits (<code>n</code> and <code>.m</code> are optional).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples: </strong></p>
<pre class="code-command">System.out.printf("Hello%2d and %6s", 8, "HI!!!\n");
</pre> 
<pre class="code-output">Hello*8 and ****HI!!!   <span class="code-comment">// * denotes white-spaces inserted by format specifier</span>
</pre>
<pre class="code-command">System.out.printf("Hi,%s%4d\n", "Hello", 88);
</pre>
<pre class="code-output">Hi,Hello**88
</pre>
<pre class="code-command">System.out.printf("Hi, %d %4.2f\n", 8, 5.556);
</pre>
<pre class="code-output">Hi, 8 5.56
</pre>
<pre class="code-command">System.out.printf("Hi,%-4s&amp;%6.2f\n", "Hi", 5.5);  <span class="code-comment">// '%-ns' for left-align String</span>
</pre>
<pre class="code-output">Hi,Hi**&amp;**5.50
</pre>
<pre class="code-command">System.out.printf("Hi, Hi, %.4f\n", 5.56);
</pre>
<pre class="code-output">Hi, Hi, 5.5600
</pre>
<p>Take note that <code>printf()</code> does not advance the cursor to the next line after printing.  You need to explicitly print a new-line character <code>'\n'</code> at the end of the formatting-string to advance the cursor to the next line, if desires.</p>

<p>There are many more format specifiers in Java. Refer to JDK Documentation for all the format specifier.</p>

<p>(Also take note that <code>printf()</code> take a variable number of arguments (or <em>varargs</em>), which is a new feature introduced in Java SE 5 in order to support <code>printf()</code>)</p>
<h4>Input From Keyboard via "Scanner" (JDK 1.5)</h4>
<p>Java, like all other languages, supports three standard input/output streams: <code>System.in</code> (standard input device), <code>System.out</code> (standard output device), and <code>System.err</code> (standard error device). The <code>System.in</code> is defaulted to be the keyword; while <code>System.out</code> and <code>System.err</code> are defaulted to the console. They can be <em>re-directed</em>  to other devices, e.g., it is quite common to redirect <code>System.err</code> to a disk file to save these error message.</p>
<p>You can read input from keyboard via <code>System.in</code> (standard input device).</p>
<p>Java SE 5 introduced a new class called <code>Scanner</code> in package <code>java.util</code> to simplify <em>formatted input</em> (and a new method <code>printf()</code> for formatted output). 
You can construct a <code>Scanner</code> to <em>scan</em> input from <code>System.in</code>, and use methods such as <code>nextInt()</code>, <code>nextDouble()</code>, <code>next()</code> to <em>parse</em> the next <code>int</code>, <code>double</code> and <code>String</code> token (delimited by white space of blank, tab and newline); or method <code>nextLine()</code> to read the entire line.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>The <code>Scanner</code> supports many other input formats. Check the JDK documentation page, under package <code>java.util</code> ⇒ class <code>Scanner</code> ⇒ Method.</p>

<h4>Input from Text File via "Scanner" (JDK 1.5)</h4>
<p>Other than  scanning <code>System.in</code> (keyboard), you can connect your <code>Scanner</code> to scan any input source, such as <em>a disk file</em> or <em>a network</em> socket, and use the same methods <code>nextInt()</code>, <code>nextDouble()</code>, <code>next()</code>, <code>nextLine()</code> to parse the next <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, <code>String</code> and line.  For example,</p>
<pre class="code-example">Scanner in = new Scanner(new File("in.txt"));  <span class="code-comment">// Construct a Scanner to scan a text file</span>
<span class="code-comment">// Use the same methods as scanning System.in</span>
int anInt = in.nextInt();
double aDouble = in.nextDouble();
String str = in.next();
String line = in.nextLine();
</pre>

<p>To open a file via <code>new File(<em>filename</em>)</code>, you need to handle the so-called <code>FileNotFoundException</code>,
i.e., the file that you are trying to open cannot be found. Otherwise,
you cannot compile your program. There are two ways to handle this
exception: <em>throws</em> or <em>try-catch</em>.</p>

<h4>Formatted Output to Text File</h4>
<p>Java SE 5.0 also introduced a so-called <code>Formatter</code> for formatted output (just like <code>Scanner</code> for formatted input). A <code>Formatter</code> has a method called <code>format()</code>. The <code>format()</code> method has the same syntax as <code>printf()</code>, i.e., it could use format specifiers to specify the format of the argument. Again, you can handle the <code>FileNotFoundException</code> as above.</p>

<h4>Input via a Dialog Box</h4>

<p>Dissecting the Program</p>
<ul>
<li>In Line 1, the import statement is needed to use the <code>JOptionPane</code>.</li>
<li>In Line 7, we use the method <code>JOptionPane.showInputDialog(promptMessage)</code> to prompt users for an input, which returns the input as a <code>String</code>.</li>
<li>Line 8 converts the input <code>String</code> to a <code>double</code>, using the method <code>Double.parseDouble()</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>java.io.Console (JDK 1.6)</h4>
<p>Java SE 6 introduced a new <code>java.io.Console</code> class to simplify character-based input/output to/from the system console. BUT, the <code>Console</code> class does not run under Eclipse/Netbeans.</p>

<p>To use the new <code>Console</code> class, you first use <code>System.console()</code> to retrieve the  <code>Console</code> object corresponding to the current system console.</p>
<pre class="code-example">Console con = System.console();
</pre>
<p>You can then use methods such as <code>readLine()</code> to read a line. You can optionally include a prompting message with format specifiers (e.g., <code>%d</code>, <code>%s</code>) in the prompting message.</p>
<pre class="code-example">String inLine = con.readLine();
String msg = con.readLine("Enter your message: ");        <span class="code-comment">// readLine() with prompting message</span>
String msg = con.readLine("%s, enter message: ", name);   <span class="code-comment">// Prompting message with format specifier</span>
</pre>
<p>You can use <code>con.printf()</code> for formatted output with format specifiers such as <code>%d</code>, <code>%s</code>.
You can also connect the <code>Console</code> to a <code>Scanner</code> for formatted input, i.e., parsing primitives such as <code>int</code>, <code>double</code>, for example,</p>
<pre class="code-example">Scanner in = new Scanner(con.reader());  <span class="code-comment">// Use Scanner to scan the Console</span>
<span class="code-comment">// Use the Scanner's methods such as nextInt(), nextDouble() to parse primitives</span> 
int anInt = in.nextInt();
double aDouble = in.nextDouble();
String str = in.next();
String line = in.nextLine();
</pre>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<pre class="code-listing"><strong>import java.io.Console;</strong>
import java.util.Scanner;
   
public class ConsoleTest {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      <strong>Console con = System.console();</strong>   <span class="code-comment">// Retrieve the Console object</span>
      <span class="code-comment">// Console class does not work in Eclipse/Netbeans</span>
      if (con == null) {
          System.err.println("Console Object is not available.");
          System.exit(1);
      }
   
      <span class="code-comment">// Read a line with a prompting message</span>
      String name = <strong>con.readLine("Enter your Name: ")</strong>;
      <strong>con.printf("Hello %s\n", name);</strong>
      <span class="code-comment">// Use the console with Scanner for parsing primitives</span>
      <strong>Scanner in = new Scanner(con.reader());</strong>
      con.printf("Enter an integer: ");
      int anInt = in.nextInt();
      con.printf("The integer entered is %d\n", anInt);
      con.printf("Enter a floating point number: ");
      double aDouble = in.nextDouble();
      con.printf("The floating point number entered is %f\n", aDouble);
   }
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>Console</code> class also provides a secure mean for password entry via method <code>readPassword()</code>. This method disables input echoing and keep the password in a <code>char[]</code> instead of a <code>String</code>. The <code>char[]</code>
containing the password can be and should be overwritten, removing it
from memory as soon as it is no longer needed. (Recall that <code>String</code>s are immutable and cannot be overwritten. When they are longer needed, they will be garbage-collected at an unknown instance.)</p>

<pre class="code-listing">import java.io.Console;
import java.util.Arrays;
   
public class ConsoleReadPasswordTest {
   static String login;
   static <strong>char[] password</strong>;

         System.exit(1);
      }
   
      login = con.readLine("Enter your login Name: ");
      <strong>password = con.readPassword("Enter your password: ")</strong>;

<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p>Suppose that you want to find the average of the marks for a class
of 30 students, you certainly do not want to create 30 variables: <code>mark1</code>, <code>mark2</code>, ..., <code>mark30</code>. You could use a single array (of 30 elements) instead.</p>

<ul>
<li>An array is <em>a list of elements of the same type</em>, identified by a pair of square brackets <code>[ ]</code>.</li>
<li>An array must be declared with a <em>name</em> and a <em>type</em> (the same as a variable). Use a plural name for array, e.g., <code>marks</code>, <code>rows</code>, <code>numbers</code>.</li>
<li>An array must be  <em>allocated</em> using <code>new</code> operator, or through <em>initialization</em>, e.g.,
  <pre class="code-example">int[] marks;  <span class="code-comment">// Declare an int array named marks</span>
int marks[];  <span class="code-comment">// Same as above, but the above syntax recommended</span>
marks = new int[5];   <span class="code-comment">// Allocate 5 elements via the "new" operator</span>
<span class="code-comment">// Declare and allocate a 20-element array in one statement via "new" operator</span>
int[] factors = new int[20];
<span class="code-comment">// Declare, allocate a 6-element array thru initialization</span>
int[] numbers = {11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66};
</pre>
</li>
<li>The element of an array can be referenced via an index (or subscript) enclosed within the square bracket <code>[ ]</code>.  Java's array index begins with zero (<code>0</code>). For example, suppose that <code>marks</code> is an <code>int</code> array of 5 elements, then the 5 elements are: <code>marks[0]</code>, <code>marks[1]</code>, <code>marks[2]</code>, <code>marks[3]</code>, and <code>marks[4]</code>.</li>

<pre class="code-example">int[] marks = new int[5];   <span class="code-comment">// Declare &amp; allocate a 5-element int array</span>
<span class="code-comment">// Assign values to the elements</span>
marks[0] = 95;
marks[1] = 85;
marks[2] = 77;
marks[3] = 69;
marks[4] = 66;
System.out.println(marks[0]);
System.out.println(marks[3] + marks[4]);
</pre>
<li>To create an array, you need to known the length (or size) of the
array in advance, and allocate accordingly. Once an array is created,
its length is fixed and cannot be changed. At times, it is hard to
ascertain the length of an array (e.g., how many students?).
Nonetheless, you need to estimate the length and allocate possibly an
upper bound. This is probably the major drawback of using an array. </li>
<li>In Java, the length of array is kept in an <em>associated variable</em> called <code>length</code> and can be retrieved using "<code><em>arrayName</em>.length</code>", e.g.,
<pre class="code-example">int[] factors = new int[5];       <span class="code-comment">// Declare and allocate a 5-element int array</span>
int numFactor = factors.length;  <span class="code-comment">// numFactor is 5
</span></pre>
The indexes of an array are between <code>0</code> and <code><em>arrayName</em>.length - 1</code>.</li>
<li>Unlike languages like C/C++, Java performs array <em>index-bound check</em> at the <em>runtime</em>.
In other words, for each reference to an array element, the index is
checked against the array's length. If the index is outside the range
of <code>[0, arrayName.legnth-1]</code>, the Java Runtime will signal an exception called <code> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException</code>.
It is important to note that checking array index-bound consumes
computation power, which inevitably slows down the processing. However,
the benefits gained in terms of good software engineering weighted more
than the slowdown in speed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Array &amp; Loop</h4>
<p>Arrays works with loops. You can process all the elements of an array via a loop, for example,</p>

<h4>"for-each" Loop (JDK 1.5)</h4>
<p>Java SE 5 introduced a new loop syntax known as <em>for-each</em> loop, which takes the following syntax:</p>

<table class="table-program">
<tbody><tr>
<th>SYNTAX</th>
<th>EXAMPLE</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<pre class="code-syntax"><strong>for (</strong> <em>type eachItem</em> <strong>:</strong> <em>anArray</em> <strong>) {</strong>
   <em>body</em> <strong>;
}</strong>
<span class="code-comment">// <em>type</em> must be the same as the
// <em>anArray</em>'s type
</span>
&nbsp;
</pre></td>
<td>
<pre class="code-explanation">int[] numbers = {8, 2, 6, 4, 3};
int sum = 0;
for (int number : numbers) {   <span class="code-comment">// for each int number in int[] numbers</span>
   sum += number;
}
System.out.println("The sum is " + sum);
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>For-each loop requires fewer lines of codes to transverse all the elements of an array. However, it can <em>read</em> the elements only, and cannot modify the contents of array.</p>

<h4>Multi-Dimensional Array</h4>
<p>In Java, you can declare an array of arrays. For examples:</p>
<pre class="code-example">int grid[][] = new int[12][8];   <span class="code-comment">// a 12×8 grid of int</span>
grid[0][0] = 8;
grid[1][1] = 5;
System.out.println(grid.length);      <span class="code-comment">// 12</span>
System.out.println(grid[0].length);   <span class="code-comment">// 8</span>
System.out.println(grid[11].length);  <span class="code-comment">// 8</span>
</pre>

<p>In the above example, <code>grid</code> is an array of 12 elements. Each of the elements (<code>grid[0]</code> to <code>grid[11]</code>) is an 8-element <code>int</code> array. In other words, <code>grid</code> is a "12-element array" of "8-element int arrays". Hence, <code>grid.length</code> gives <code>12</code> and <code>grid[0].length</code> gives <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>To be precise, Java does not support multi-dimensional array directly. In other words, it does not support syntax like <code>grid[3, 2]</code>, like some other languages. Furthermore, it is possible that the arrays in an array-of-arrays have different length.</p>

<h4>Command-Line Arguments</h4>
<p>Java's <code>main()</code> method takes an argument - <code>String[] args</code>, i.e., a <code>String</code> array named <code>args</code>.
This argument corresponds to the so-called "command-line arguments"
supplied by the user when the java program is invoked. For example, if
a Java program called <code>Arithmetic</code> is invoked as follows (in a "cmd" shell):</p>
<pre class="code-command">&gt; java Arithmetic 12 3456 +
</pre>
<p>The items <code>"12"</code>, <code>"3456"</code> and <code>"+"</code> are called the command-line arguments. These arguments will be packed into a <code>String</code> array and passed into the <code>main()</code> method as the parameter <code>args</code> by the Java Runtime. In other words, args has the following properties:</p>
<pre class="code-example">args = {"12", "3456", "+"}   <span class="code-comment">// "args" is a String array</span>
args.length = 3              <span class="code-comment">// length of the array args</span>
args[0] = "12"   <span class="code-comment">            // Each element of the array is a String</span>
args[1] = "3456"
args[2] = "+"
args[0].length() = 2   <span class="code-comment">      // length of the String</span>
args[1].length() = 4
args[2].length() = 1
</pre>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> The program <code>Arithmetic</code> reads three parameters form the command-line, two integers and an arithmetic operator (<code>'+'</code>, <code>'-'</code>, <code>'*'</code>, or <code>'/'</code>), and performs the arithmetic operation accordingly. For example,</p>
<pre class="code-output">&gt; <strong>java Arithmetic 3 2 +</strong>
3+2=5
&gt; <strong>java Arithmetic 3 2 -</strong>
3-2=1
&gt; <strong>java Arithmetic 3 2 /</strong>
3/2=1

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>At times, a certain portion of codes has to be used many times.
Instead of re-writing the codes many times, it is better to put them
into a "subroutine", and "call" this subroutine many time. Subroutine
is also called method (in Java) or function (in C/C++).</p>
<p>Two parties are involved in using a method: a <em>caller</em>, who calls the method, and the <em>method</em>
to be called. The caller passes parameters to the method. The method
receives these parameters, performs the programmed operations, and
returns the result back to the caller.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that we need to evaluate the area of a circle many times, it is better to write a method called <code>computeCircleArea()</code>, and re-use it when needed.</p>

<pre class="code-listing">public class MethodTest {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      double radius1 = 1.1, area1, area2;

<p>In the above example, a reusable method called <code>computeCircleArea()</code> is defined, which receives a parameter in <code>double</code> from the caller, performs the calculation, and return a <code>double</code> result to the caller.  In the <code>main()</code>, we invoke <code>computeCircleArea()</code> methods thrice, each time with a different parameter.</p>

<p>The syntax for method definition is as follows:</p>
<pre class="code-syntax"><strong>public static</strong> <em>return-value-typ</em>e <em>methodName </em><strong>(</strong> <em>parameter-1-type parameter-1</em>, <em>parameter-2-type parameter-2</em>,... <strong>) {</strong>
   <em>body</em> <strong>;
}
</strong></pre>

<p>Inside the method body, you could use a <code>return</code> statement to return a value (of the <code>return-value-type</code> declared in the method's signature) to return a value back to the caller. The syntax is:</p>
<pre class="code-syntax">return <em>a-return-value</em>;   <span class="code-comment">// of <em>return-value-type</em> declared in method's signature</span>
</pre>

<p><strong>Method Naming Convention:</strong> A method's name is a
verb, comprising one or more words. The first word is in lowercase,
while the rest are initial-capitalized. For example, <code>getArea()</code>, <code>setRadius()</code>, <code>moveDown()</code>, <code>isPrime()</code>, etc.</p>

<h4>"void" return-value type</h4>

<p>Suppose that you need a method to perform certain actions (e.g.,
printing) without a need to return a value to the caller, you can
declare its return-value type as <code>void</code>. In the method's body, you could use a "<code>return;</code>" statement (without a return value) to return control to the caller - anywhere within the method's body. In this case, the <code>return</code> statement is optional. If there is no <code>return</code> statement, the entire body will be executed, and control returns to the caller at the end of the body.</p>

<p>Notice that <code>main()</code> is a method with a return-value type of <code>void</code>. <code>main()</code> is called by the Java runtime, perform the actions defined in the body, and return nothing back to the Java runtime.</p>

<h4>Actual Parameters vs. Formal Parameters</h4>
<p>Recall that a method receives parameters from its caller, performs
the actions defined in the method's body, and return a value (or
nothing) to the caller.</p>
<p>In the above example, the variable <code>(double radius)</code> declared in the signature of <code>computeCircleArea(double radius)</code> is known as <em>formal parameter</em>. Its scope is within the method's body. When the method is invoked by a caller, the caller must supply a so-called <em>actual parameter</em>, whose value is then used for the actual computation. For example, when the method is invoked via "<code>area1=computeCircleArea(radius1)</code>", <code>radius1</code> is the actual parameter, with a value of <code>1.1</code>.</p>

<h4>Mathematical Methods</h4>
<p>JDK provides many common-used Mathematical methods in a class called <code>Math</code>. The signatures of some of these methods are:</p>
<pre class="code-syntax">double Math.pow(double x, double y) <span class="code-comment">// returns x raises to power of y</span>
double Math.sqrt(double x)          <span class="code-comment">// returns the square root of x</span>
double Math.random()                <span class="code-comment">// returns a random number in [0.0, 1.0)</span>
double Math.sin()
double Math.cos()</pre>


<p>The <code>Math</code> class also provide two constants:</p>
<pre class="code-syntax">Math.PI   <span class="code-comment">// 3.141592653589793</span>
Math.E    <span class="code-comment">// 2.718281828459045</span>
</pre>

<p>To check all the available methods, open JDK API documentation ⇒ select <em>package</em> "<code>java.lang</code>" ⇒ select <em>class</em> "<code>Math</code>" ⇒ choose <em>method</em>.</p>

<p>For examples,</p>
<pre class="code-example">int secretNumber = (int)Math.random()*100;  <span class="code-comment">// Generate a random int between 0 and 99</span>
&nbsp;
double radius = 5.5;
double area = radius*radius*Math.PI;
area = Math.pow(radius, 2)*Math.PI;         <span class="code-comment">// Not as efficient as above</span>
&nbsp;
int x1 = 1, y1 = 1, x2 = 2, y2 = 2;
double distance = Math.sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1));
int dx = x2 - x1;
int dy = y2 - y1;
distance = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);        <span class="code-comment">// Slightly more efficient</span>
</pre>

<h3>Bit-wise Operations</h3>

<h4>Bit-wise Logical Operations</h4>

<p>Bit-wise manipulation operators perform operation on one or two operands on a bit-by-bit basis.</p>

<table class="table-data">
<tbody><tr>
  <th> OPERATOR</th>
  <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>&amp;</strong></code></td>
  <td>Bit-wise AND</td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>|</strong></code></td>
  <td>Bit-wise OR</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>!</strong></code></td>
  <td>Bit-wise NOT</td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>^</strong></code></td>
  <td>Bit-wise XOR</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>




<h4>Bit-Shift Operations</h4>

<p>Bit-shift operators perform left or right shift on an operand by a
specified number of bits. Right-shift can be either signed-extended (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) (padded with signed bit) or unsigned-extended (<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>) (padded with zeros). Left-shift is always padded with zeros (for both signed and unsigned).</p>

<table class="table-data">
<tbody><tr>
  <th> OPERATOR</th>
  <th>USAGE</th>
  <th>DESCRIPTION</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>&lt;&lt;</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>operand &lt;&lt; number</code></td>
  <td>Left-shift and padded with zeros</td>
</tr>
<tr class="table-row-alt">
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>&gt;&gt;</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>operand &gt;&gt; number</code></td>
  <td>Right-shift and padded with sign bit (signed-extended right-shift)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="td-center"><code><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></code></td>
  <td><code>operand &gt;&gt;&gt; number</code></td>
  <td>Right-shift and padded with zeros (unsigned-extended right-shift)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Since all the Java's integers (byte, short, int and long) are signed
integers, left-shift &lt;&lt; and right-shift &gt;&gt; operators
perform signed-extended bit shift. Signed-extended right shift &gt;&gt;
pads the most significant bits with the sign bit to maintain its sign
(i.e., padded with zeros for positive numbers and ones for negative
numbers). Operator &gt;&gt;&gt; is needed to perform unsigned-extended
right shift, which always pads the most significant bits with zeros.
There is no difference between the signed-extended and
unsigned-extended left shift, as both operations pad the least
significant bits with zeros.</p>
